# Work in progress

## Current high-level goal

## Current concrete goal

# TODO

## Features

- Needed for semester project:
  - Import library for html serving with callbacks for loading of elements
  - Easy simulation 
    - w/o network
    - local network
    - network with bw and delay -> on Deterlab

## Bugs

- flmodules/web_proxy has horrible error handling - too many `expect`s
- flarch/webrtc errors - perhaps not necessary to fix if matchbox works:
  - Find why the network stalls after some time
  - Doesn't work in EPFL network

## Cleanups / improvements

- yaml files are stored as .toml
  - make sure old files can be read as .toml
  - save new files as .yaml
  - delete old .toml files
- serde_yaml is deprecated
  - use serde_yaml_ng with singleton_map_recursive
- use matchbox from https://github.com/johanhelsing/matchbox
- rewrite the flmodules/src/*/broker.rs :
  - the returned broker should only represent the actual i/o messages
  - add an internal message enum to separate them from the outside messages
  - think how the `Overlay` (should be renamed to `Adapter` or so) can be
  redone. One possibility is to have the network module using a good
  `NetworkMessage` which includes the `NetworkWrapper` and can also be used
  by `Random` and `Loopix`.
    - Question: how to handle special messages then? Like asking to reshuffle
    connections in `random` or accessing the providers in `loopix`?
- Clean up broker / network:
  - Remove `Destination::{All,Others,This}` - Test it
    only `Destination::All` is ever used
  - Replace `process` with `async-task`
    Not sure what is up with that. `process` is a method from `Broker`, while `async-task` is a crate
  - Add `process_msg` with a `Destination::Settle<Vec<BrokerID>>`
    Again, two years later, no idea...

## Reaching out

- Sign up for dev6

# Dates

2022-09-12:
- update to latest versions of wasm libraries

2022-09-09:
- Clean up broker / network:
  - change enums with `((a, b))` arguments to simple `(a, b)` arguments
  - remove `Destination` from `SubsystemListener`

2022-05-29:
- make github workflows pass
- Update docker
- correctly interpret old config data

2022-05-24:
- DISPLAY: flbrowser displays last ping as descending, but it should increase
- BUG: messages get deleted after restart
- CLEANUP:
  - move `NodeData` into `Node`
  - `npm audit fix` in flbrowser
  - rename `DataStorage` and perhaps move it back to flarch?

2022-05-22:
- Finalize usage of broker-modules in `Node` and `Network`:
  - Create a `WebRTC` and a `Websocket` broker-module
  - Pass these broker-modules to `Network`
  - Pass a `Network` to the `Node` instead of the WebRTC and Websocket spawners
  - flnet-wasm and flnet-libc should directly offer a `Network` for the specific arch

2022-05-21:
- cleanup `flutils`:
  - move `broker` to flmodules
  - move `arch` to `impl`, but rename `impl` to `arch`, and `arch` to `tasks`
- update READMEs

2022-05-18:
- Updated version to 0.6.0
- Cleaned up Cargo.tomls
- Started updating READMEs
- flnet-wasm includes old parking-lot crate because of wasm-timer - but don't want to replace it...

2022-05-16:
- Finish porting of old fledger code:
  - Add flnode binary
  - Add webpage
- update web
- Add connection-type again
- ping-timeout now correctly disconnects nodes
- Reconnection between two browsers doesn't work when quickly reconnecting -> probably difficult to fix
- Check if it's possible to use flmodules::broker::Async instead of cfgattr -> No

2022-05-13:
- added test/fledger-node to test quickly reconnecting between webrtc-wasm

2022-05-12:
- fix web_rtc_libc to remove callbacks in reset
- Fixing part of WASM
- change ping-module:
  - remove "waiting nodes" and just ping every node that is under a certain threshold
  - add counting of pings
- replace local "femme" with fixed upstream

2022-05-11:
- Fast reconnection between to CLIs does not work - "DataChannel is not opened" 

2022-05-05:
- Display some of the statistics in the browser
- Reconnection two CLIs doesn't work
- Fix browser/src/lib.rs to work with new code

2022-05-04:
- run browser without panics

2022-05-03:
- browser/src/lib.rs compiles now

2022-05-02:
- Finish fledger-cli
  - Check why gossip module does excessive messaging
- Add web
  - check why the flmodules cannot be used with wasm - probably needs the proper #[cfg_attr] annotations

2022-04-29:
- Fix TODO in broker with regard to wrong registration of subsystem
- Rewrote random connection module

2022-04-24:
- Finish DataStorageFile
- Add configuration options to fledger CLI
- Available nodes are not updated, so a node will not try to connect to a new node
- follower drops messages because it's not correctly connected - but the gossip event module
  still sends a message - why? Does the random module send out a ListUpdate before it has the
  node connected?

2022-04-23:
- add ping-module
- read and write gossip.storage
- Check why it doesn't correctly connect to the signalling server

2022-04-22:
- flnode/test/gossip_2 doesn't work anymore
- link timer
- add module-field in node messages at random

2022-04-21:
- Added flmodules and flnode crates
- Link it all together

2022-04-15:
- Check dependencies in Cargo.toml and clean up
- Clean up wasm and libc webrtc implementations

2022-04-14:
- follow TODOs

2022-04-13:
- First working inter-wasm-libc communication
- Separated wasm and libc implementations in flnet
- re-think WebSocketConnection::send - should it be async?
- Test libc webrtc implementation against wasm implementation
  - Setup new webrtc connection
- Find out why the ice candidate strings are not recognized
- Pass disconnect event in libc-webrtc

2022-03-16:
- Test libc websocket implementation
- clean-up flnet-libc/tests/websocket

2022-02-05:
- Remove wasm from node
- Cleanup network.rs, signal.rs, types.rs, to be able to move them easier.
- move things around

2022-02-01:
- starting to cleanup network, broker, and types, before the move of the different parts

2022-01-29:
- Extend the chat using gossip-messaging instead of the centralized "oracle" nodes
- high-level: Explore a framework for having multiple modules interacting with each other
- high-level: Propose a set of modules that can work together (random-connections, gossip-events)
- for the unique messages: also encode the time in the msgID, so that an
  updated unique message is also transmitted. Currently the msgID == nodeID,
  so if the 'created' field is updated, the message is not retransmitted.
- clean up names: raw::gossip_chat::message::Message
  - gossip_chat -> gossip_events
  - message::Message* -> event::Event*
- add a node-info storage to the gossip-chat or random-connection
  + replace TextMessages by a new Message with a category type
  + rewrite gossip_chat to use the new Message type
  + add node-info to the Message
  + use node-info from the Message to display the chat messages

2022-01-27:
- get texts loaded from browser storage
- re-enable display of node names (currently it's only the IDs)
- make sure config gets loaded on browser, too - currently it seems to be ignored
- debug real-network failure for new messages

2022-01-26:
- debug connection failures
- write tests
  - test if full connectivity is given
  - test if messages get correctly gossipped

2022-01-19:
- started test-framework with network dummy and first communications

2022-01-18:
- hook up the Network structure to the common-crate
  - fetch chat messages from modules
  - load messages from before

2022-01-09:
- finished implementing the message implementations of the raw modules
- use StorageData
- use 2 * log(n) connections in the random-connections handler

2022-01-08:
- set up first communications within the modules
- created Connections structure to interface with the network layer
- not really sure if it's all worth it...

2022-01-05:
- moved modules to their own crate with 'raw' and 'message' modules
- started working on the 'gossip' module
- next steps: finish 'gossip' module as a generic module, then add the 'message' code
